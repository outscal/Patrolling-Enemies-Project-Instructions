# Introduction

Aloha Clanmate! 

Welcome to the project to build patrolling enemies. Enemies are an important part of any game as that enables the player to dodge things in game and an objective that feels challenging as well for the player.

Your enemies can have a specific health, or you can decide not to give them any. The player's health can be damaged based on a condition that interacts with the enemy.

For this simple one, I will show you how enemies can be created and made to function using a simple C# script.

So, are you excited yet?

Don't forget to clone the [github repository](https://github.com/outscal/Patrolling-Enemies/tree/Problem-Statement) for this project.

Can you think of any game that uses enemies patrolling a speficic area in game?


Here are some names to help you out.

- Super Mario

- Contra

- Cuphead

Let's get deep into it then and see how unity can be used to create such an interaction.

The various steps involved in this project:
- Create or assemble assets
- Add the objects in scene to create a platform
- Add enemy objects to at different positions
- Add a C# script with the enemy movement logic
