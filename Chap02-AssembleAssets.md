# Assets in Unity

Assets simply refers to the various objects that are placed in your game so that the objects can be controlled by any user.

The assets for your game will depend on your vision of the game. 

There is a huge library of assets that are available online for free. You can also use the Unity asset store here : [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com)

In the project repository, you will find some free assets that you can use as well in the branch called Problem-Statement, of course you can inport any other models too.

# Importing Assets

For any created models, you can use the import function to get any model inside of a unity scene.

# Sprite Renderer

Once the models or pictures are imported, you can use the Sprite Renderer component for any gameobject to render the sprite onto the GameObject. Click on "Add Component" -> "Sprite Renderer" in the inspector after adding an Emmpty Gameobject.

Once the Renderer component is added to your GameObject, you can drag and drop the image to the slot called 'Sprite' to render the image onto the scene.
